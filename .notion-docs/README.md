## 📊 Recommended Notion Structure

```
📁 PO Tool Project
├── 📄 Project Overview
├── 🗂️ Features (Database)
├── 🐛 Issues & Bugs (Database)
├── 📚 Technical Documentation
├── 🔗 API Documentation
├── 🗺️ Roadmap (Database)
└── ⚙️ Setup Guide
```

### Creating This Structure

1. Create a new page titled "PO Tool Project"
2. Import `01-PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md` - this becomes your landing page
3. Create 3 databases by importing CSV files:
   - Features Database (from `02-FEATURES-DATABASE.csv`)
   - Issues Database (from `03-ISSUES-DATABASE.csv`)
   - Roadmap Database (from `06-ROADMAP.csv`)
4. Create sub-pages and import markdown:
   - Technical Documentation (from `04-TECHNICAL-DOCS.md`)
   - API Documentation (from `05-API-DOCS.md`)
   - Setup Guide (from `07-SETUP-GUIDE.md`)
5. Link all pages together

## 🎨 Customizing in Notion

### Add Icons & Covers
- Click the page title to add emoji icons
- Click "Add cover" for visual covers

### Database Views
For each database, create multiple views:

**Features Database**:
- By Status (Board view)
- By Category (Board view)
- By Priority (Table view)
- Implementation Timeline (Timeline view)

**Issues Database**:
- By Status (Board view)
- By Priority (Table view)
- Open Issues Only (Filtered view)
- Fixed Issues (Filtered view)

**Roadmap Database**:
- By Quarter (Timeline view)
- By Status (Board view)
- By Priority (Table view)
- Dependencies (Table view with filters)

### Add Relations
Create relations between databases:
- Link Issues to Features (which feature does this bug affect?)
- Link Roadmap items to Issues (which issue does this solve?)
- Link Features to Roadmap (which features are planned next?)

## 📝 Keeping Documentation Updated
