## Business Rules Implemented

### Role Hierarchy
1. **SUPER_ADMIN** - Always auto-approves, full platform control
2. **ADMIN** - Auto-approve own POs (configurable), can approve others
3. **MANAGER** - Needs approval for POs ≥ threshold
4. **VIEWER** - Cannot create POs

### Approval Logic
- **Default threshold:** £50 (calculated on subtotal BEFORE tax)
- **Configurable threshold:** £0 - £1,000,000
- **Auto-routing:** All ADMINs can approve, first to act wins
- **Atomic operations:** Database transactions prevent double-approval
- **Audit trail:** Immutable record of all approval actions

### Status Workflow
```
DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED → (auto-sends email to supplier)
                         ↓
                      DENIED → DRAFT (editable, resubmittable)
```
