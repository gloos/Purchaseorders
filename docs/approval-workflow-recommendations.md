# Approval Workflow - Recommendations & Alternatives

## Executive Summary

Two features have been planned:
1. **Organization onboarding** during signup
2. **PO approval workflow** with threshold-based routing

## Key Recommendations

### 🎯 Simplifications for Better UX

1. **Auto-routing instead of manager selection dropdown**
   - **Current plan**: User selects which manager to request approval from
   - **Recommendation**: Auto-route to any available admin
   - **Why**: Reduces friction, prevents bottlenecks, simpler UX
   - **Implementation**: All admins see pending approvals, first to act wins

2. **Role naming consistency**
   - **Current**: Manager/Viewer
   - **Better**: Admin/Member or Admin/User
   - **Why**: Industry standard, clearer permissions

3. **Progressive disclosure for settings**
   - Start with simple threshold
   - Add advanced rules later based on usage

### ⚠️ Critical Edge Cases to Handle

1. **Single admin scenario**
   - Problem: Admin needs approval for own POs
   - Solution: Add "auto-approve own POs" setting (default: true)

2. **Existing users without organizations**
   - Problem: Current users will break after update
   - Solution: Migration script + prompt on next login

3. **Approval limbo**
   - Problem: POs stuck if admin doesn't respond
   - Solutions:
     - Email reminders after 24/48 hours
     - Optional auto-escalation
     - "Approval expires in X days" setting

### 💡 Alternative Approaches

#### Option A: Simplified Two-Tier System (Recommended)
```
Admin: Can do everything, including approve
Member: Can create POs, needs approval above threshold
```
**Pros**: Simple, clear, easy to implement
**Cons**: Less granular control

#### Option B: Three-Tier with Viewer Role
```
Admin: Full control
Member: Create POs, need approval
Viewer: Read-only access (for accountants)
```
**Pros**: Better for larger organizations
**Cons**: More complex implementation

#### Option C: Rule-Based System
```
Instead of fixed threshold, use rules:
- Amount > £1000 → needs approval
- Category = "IT" AND amount > £500 → needs approval
- Vendor = "New" → needs approval
```
**Pros**: Flexible, powerful
**Cons**: Complex UI, harder to understand

### 📊 Phased Rollout Strategy

**Phase 1 (MVP)** - 2 weeks
- Basic approval threshold
- Simple approve/deny
- Email notifications

**Phase 2 (Enhancement)** - 2 weeks
- Dashboard widget customization
- Audit trail
- Denial reasons

**Phase 3 (Advanced)** - Future
- Multiple approval levels
- Category-based rules
- Delegation/vacation mode

### 🔴 Potential Issues with Current Design

1. **Manager dropdown is problematic**
   - What if selected manager is on vacation?
   - What if they're no longer with company?
   - Creates unnecessary decision fatigue
   - **Fix**: Show to all admins

2. **"Viewer" terminology is confusing**
   - Viewers sound read-only but can create POs
   - **Fix**: Rename to "Member" or "User"

3. **No mention of email notifications**
   - Critical for approval workflow
   - **Fix**: Add email templates for:
     - New approval request
     - Approval/denial notification
     - Daily digest of pending approvals

### ✅ Quick Wins to Include

1. **Bulk actions**
   - Approve/deny multiple POs at once
   - Common reasons dropdown

2. **Smart defaults**
   - £1000 threshold for most businesses
   - Auto-approve for admins
   - 7-day approval expiry

3. **Quick filters**
   - "My pending approvals"
   - "Waiting on me"
   - "Recently actioned"

### 📈 Success Metrics

Track these to validate the feature:
- Average approval time (target: < 4 hours)
- % of POs requiring approval (target: 20-30%)
- Abandonment rate (POs never approved/denied)
- User satisfaction score

### 🚀 Minimum Viable Implementation

If time is limited, here's the absolute minimum:

1. **Database**: Add `approvalThreshold` to Organization
2. **Check**: If PO amount > threshold && user !== ADMIN
3. **Flow**: Create PO with `PENDING_APPROVAL` status
4. **Admin page**: List of pending approvals with approve/deny buttons
5. **Email**: Send notification to admins
6. **Complete**: Update status and notify creator

This can be built in 3-4 days and enhanced later.

### 🤔 Questions to Consider

Before implementation:

1. **Business Logic**
   - Should approved POs auto-send or stay in draft?
   - Can denied POs be edited and resubmitted?
   - Do we need approval for PO modifications?

2. **Scalability**
   - Will this work with 50+ POs per day?
   - How to handle organizations with 10+ admins?
   - Performance impact of audit trails?

3. **Compliance**
   - Are audit logs legally required?
   - Data retention policies?
   - GDPR considerations for denial reasons?

## Final Recommendation

**Start simple, iterate based on usage:**

1. Implement basic threshold-based approval
2. Use auto-routing (not dropdown)
3. Include email notifications from day 1
4. Add audit trail in phase 2
5. Consider advanced rules only if requested

This approach balances functionality with development time and user experience.
